Unzip the source (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into a folder on your local drive, say C:\Users\yourname\Documents\R\

Put run_analysis.R into C:\Users\yourname\Documents\R\UCI HAR Dataset\

In RStudio: setwd("C:\\Users\\yourname\\Documents\\R\\UCI HAR Dataset\\"), followed by: source("run_analysis.R")
